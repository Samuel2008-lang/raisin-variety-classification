# Raisin Variety Classification 🍇

This project uses **Logistic Regression** to classify raisin varieties (Kecimen vs Besni) from the **Raisin Dataset**.

## 📂 Files in this Repository
- `Raisin_prediction.ipynb` → Google Colab notebook with full code and results  
- `Raisin_Dataset.csv` → Dataset used for training and testing  
- `README.md` → Project documentation  

## ⚙️ Steps Performed
1. Loaded and explored the dataset  
2. Split data into **80% training** and **20% testing**  
3. Applied **Logistic Regression** model  
4. Performed **5-Fold Cross-Validation**  
5. Evaluated results with **accuracy score** and **classification report**  

## 📊 Results
- **Cross-Validation Mean Accuracy:** ~86%  
- **Test Accuracy:** ~89%  
- Successfully exceeded the required **81% accuracy** ✅  

## 🚀 How to Run
1. Open the notebook in Google Colab  
2. Upload `Raisin_Dataset.csv` into Colab  
3. Run all cells
